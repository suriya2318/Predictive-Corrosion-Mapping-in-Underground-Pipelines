# Predictive-Corrosion-Mapping-in-Underground-Pipelines
This Excel-based project predicts underground pipeline corrosion using sensor data (Soil pH, Moisture, Temperature, GPR). It applies linear regression, anomaly detection, and Monte Carlo simulation to identify high-risk zones. The result is a visual dashboard for preventive maintenance planning.
